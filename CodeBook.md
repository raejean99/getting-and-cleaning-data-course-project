The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

For each original record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

subject: the user ID of the volunteer users. ID is from 1 to 30.

activity: the type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. 

1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING 

feature: 79 feature related to "mean" and "std", selected out of 561 features. Some modification to the feature name has been done. Such as: "-" is removed from the result set. For instances,

 [1] tBodyAccmeanX   that is: tBodyAcc-mean()-X           
 [2] tBodyAccmeanY   that is: tBodyAcc-mean()-Y            
 [3] tBodyAccmeanZ   that is: tBodyAcc-mean()-Z            
 [4] tBodyAccstdX    that is: tBodyAcc-std()-X            
 [5] tBodyAccstdY    that is: tBodyAcc-std()-Y            
 [6] tBodyAccstdZ    that is: tBodyAcc-std()-Z   
 
 The rules apply to all the 79 feature names.
